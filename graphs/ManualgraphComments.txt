All ManualGraphs for comparing k-greedy with local search for representative submodular maximization problem are created the following algorithm:
      For every pair of vertices (u, v) randomly chose a value p from P.
       Place an edge from u to v with probability p.
       Here we have to consider all possible pairs, so you should consider both the pairs (u v) and (v u).
       But do not consider pairs of the form (u u).

ManualGraph1: n = 100,  P ={0.2}

ManualGraph2: n = 100, P = {0.2, 0.4}

ManualGraph3: n = 100, P = {0.2, 0.4, 0.6}
